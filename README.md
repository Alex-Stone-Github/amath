# amath
A common math library for matrices and such.

## Features
This library provides sized and unsized linear algebra structures that make it easy
to do lots of differnet types of math. 

## Future 
In the future this library may expand to include more math / utility stuff for my
future projects, but for now, it is fine the way that it is.
